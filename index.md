## About Me

I am a Master's student at the [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](http://www.mbzuai.ac.ae) majoring in Machine Learning. At MBZUAI, I am affliated with the [Intelligent Visual Analytics Lab (IVAL)](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/). I am advised by [Dr. Salman](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) and [Dr. Muzammal](https://muzammal-naseer.netlify.app/).


I received my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from the [National Institute of Technology (NIT) Srinagar, India](https://nitsri.ac.in/). After graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning engineer at [Harman International (Samsung)](https://www.harman.com/India) before transitioning into academia in 2021 and joining MBZUAI as a Research Assistant.



## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Seld-Supervised learning, data-efficient Vision Transformers, open-world semantic segmentation using Vision-Language models, and 3D image
segmentation.

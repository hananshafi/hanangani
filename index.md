## About Me

I am a Master's student at the [Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](http://www.mbzuai.ac.ae) majoring in Machine Learning. At MBZUAI, I am affliated with the [Intelligent Visual Analytics Lab (IVAL)](https://www.ival-mbzuai.com/). I am primarily advised by [Dr. Salman](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) and mentored by  [Dr. Muzammal](https://muzammal-naseer.netlify.app/). My secondary advisor is [Dr. Fahad Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home).


I received my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from the [National Institute of Technology (NIT) Srinagar, India](https://nitsri.ac.in/). After graduation, I worked as a Machine Learning engineer at [Harman International (Samsung)](https://www.harman.com/India) before transitioning into academia in 2021 and joining MBZUAI as a Research Assistant under [Dr. Mohammad Yaqub](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=9dfn5GkAAAAJ&hl=en)



## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Label-efficient learning with applications to open-world settings, multi-modal learning, Diffusion models and 3D segmentation.
